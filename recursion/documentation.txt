Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself as a subroutine. This allows the function to be repeated several times, since it calls itself during its execution. Functions that incorporate recursion are called recursive functions.

types of recursion:
1] head recursion
2] tail recursion
3] tree recursion 
4] indirect recursion
5] nested recursion
